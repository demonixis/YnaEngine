### Current version 0.5dev

## What is Yna Engine ?

Yna is a lightweight 2D and 3D game engine using MonoGame Framework (or XNA). The goal of this project is to give the developer the ability to create games in 2D or 3D easily on multiple platforms such as Windows Phone, Windows 8, or Linux. Yna is not a complex engine compared to its competitor and suitable for all developers who want an easy way to quickly create a prototype or a game.

## Why did you change the name of the project ?

Yna was initially a simple class library with few helpers to simplify the start of a project. Over time this library has grown and today we have a good 2D module, a 3D module that beginning to be interesting and many functionalities to manage user input, storage, etc..
You can always use part of Yna as Framework, you can also pick some class to create your own library. But use of the full version of Yna will provide you a basic and lightweight but functional engine for make 2D and 3D games very easily.
